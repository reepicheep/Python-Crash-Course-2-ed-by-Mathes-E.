# Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples.
# Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

my_favorire_cars = ["Honda", "Mercedes", "Pegeout", "Ford"]
print(f"I would like to own a {my_favorire_cars[0]} car.")
print(f"My {my_favorire_cars[1]} car is great!")
print(f"I would like to drive a {my_favorire_cars[-2]} car.")
print(f"I sold my old {my_favorire_cars[-1]} car.")
